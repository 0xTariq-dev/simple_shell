# Welcome to simple shell project.
> Done for ALX SE program.

### This is project's main goal is to create a shell ap that works and behaves as the `Bourne shell (sh)`

>### **What is Shell ?**

A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.

----------------------------------------------

>### **Shell Prompt**

The prompt, `$`, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.

Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the command you want executed by looking at the first word of your input. A word is an unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs separate words.
